Hi there! 👋

This repository highlights the 10x10 trade show booth systems we build at AOM Displays.

These compact booth layouts are some of the most popular in the industry—they’re easy to set up, simple to ship, and flexible enough for a wide range of event needs. Companies use 10x10 booths for trade shows, conferences, pop-up activations, retail demos, and more.

What We Offer

We provide several booth styles within the 10x10 size category. Each option is designed for real event use and can be customized with a specific layout, graphic design package, or additional accessories.

Some of the 10x10 booth types include:

* OneFabric booths—lightweight, fast setup, full-fabric graphics  
* Tension fabric booths—clean visuals, seamless printed walls  
* Modular aluminum frame booths—reconfigurable, durable structures  
* SEG lightbox booths—bright backlit graphics with LED framing  

If you need a specific configuration, monitor mount, product display area, or extra branding surfaces, custom builds are also available.
